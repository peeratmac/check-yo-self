## [CHECK YO'SELF Live Site - Click Here](https://peeratmac.github.io/check-yo-self/)

### Final Project by [Peerat Sukcharoenyingyong](https://github.com/peeratmac)

## Learning Goals

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:

1. semantic HTML
1. clean & organized CSS styles
1. DRY JavaScript
1. localStorage to persist data

- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops/array prototype methods
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX

## Improvement Goals with Personal Reflection

- Refactor to use different array prototype methods more often whenever available
- Look for opportunity to write out unit test to verify card status, color display, and statuses of the buttons
- Possible advanced animations for adding and deleting a card without intefering with user experience (currently only have effects on buttons and urgent/delete behavior)
- Dive into Phase 4 functionalities per rubric for searching only for title or tasks, and both title and tasks at the same time
